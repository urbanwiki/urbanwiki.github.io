> [!Tip] Notice
> Urban Wiki is very young. Like... _very_ young. We are still trialing how the site will work. With that being said, we want to eventually support people contributing to the wiki from all sides of the conversation, and have it done through a proper site. Right now, you can make [issues on GitHub](https://github.com/urbanwiki/urbanwiki.github.io/issues/new/choose), or make a Pull Request.

# Requesting an Article

Thats good with us. If you're willing to write it yourself, it will be posted very quickly. Otherwise, we need to prioritize what we can write. Regardless, make an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/urbanwiki/urbanwiki.github.io/issues/new/choose) following the `Request An Article` template.

# You Have a Spelling / Typo / Grammar Mistake

Thanks for pointing it out. I'm kind of a bad speller. Please make an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/urbanwiki/urbanwiki.github.io/issues/new/choose) following the `Report A Mistake` template.
