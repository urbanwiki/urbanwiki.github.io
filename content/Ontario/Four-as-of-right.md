_Four-units-as-of-right_ is a type of zoning by-law which permits by default small scale residential uses of up to four units per lot. This by-law is enabled by changes to the planning act by [Bill 23](app://obsidian.md/More%20Homes%20Built%20Faster%20Act), which created expanded [[As-of-right|as-of-right]] development rights for small scale residential development.
