_As-of-right zoning_ (also known as _As-of-right_) is a right given to owners of property to use or develop it, without the need of approval from city council or a public hearing. It is the foundational legal framework which allows for [[Three-units-as-of-right]] and [[Four-units-as-of-right]]. [[More Homes Built Faster Act|Bill 23]] expanded *as-of-right* to include small scale residential uses of up to three units per lot, or [[Three-units-as-of-right]].
