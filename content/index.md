title: Four-as-of-Right Zoning in Oakville
---

_Four-units-as-of-right_ is a type of zoning bylaw which permits by default small scale residential uses of up to four units per lot. This bylaw is enabled by changes to the planning act by [Bill 23](), which created expanded “as of right” development rights for small scale residential development.

# What Is The Current ByLaw?

[Bill 23]() also contains a province-wide _three-units-as-of-right_ bylaw which permits by default small scale residential uses of up to three units per lot. The difference between _three-units-as-of-right_ and _four-units-as-of-right_ is a single unit, so its a marginal difference per lot, but a larger difference province-wide.

# Pros & Cons

## Pros

- Increase in the housing supply
- Gentle density
- Community driven opportunity, where residents can decide what density they want.
- _Doesn't override other zoning requirements like setbacks and stormwater infrastructure_

## Cons

- Bylaw on its own doesn't guarantee the units will be built. It only guarantees they're allowed.
- So far in Oakville, only 0.003% of eligible units for _three-units-as-of-right_ have filed for new development.
- The bylaw doesn't make a requirement for any affordable units to be built on it's own. That would have to be done in another bill or amended to this one.

# What is Oakville's Current Position?

Oakville has been slow to take a formal position. City Council voted to direct staff to write a bylaw approving _four-units-as-of-right_. They will discuss it on March 4th, 2024 and again on April
