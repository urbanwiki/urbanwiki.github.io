> [!tip] What is Urban Wiki?
> Urban Wiki is your go-to platform for centralizing planning policies, making them easily accessible and understandable for residents, city councillors, and city planners. Our mission is to eliminate the chaos and confusion often associated with urban planning by providing a centralized repository of knowledge. 

# The Problem
Traditional planning processes are disorganized and often leave everyone involved frustrated and confused. The lack of a central knowledge hub means that stakeholders are left in the dark, struggling to find the latest information on planning policies and projects. 
# Our Solution
Urban Wiki aims to address these challenges by creating a one-stop solution for planning information. We believe that a well-organized and easily navigable platform can empower residents, city councillors, and planners alike.
