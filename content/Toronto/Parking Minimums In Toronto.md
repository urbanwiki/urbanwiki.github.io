# Status of Parking Minimums in Toronto
In 2022 the city of Toronto abolished parking minimums and created maximum amounts of parking spots for certain developments. [^1]

# Cost of Parking Spots in Toronto
Building new parking in Toronto can cost $50,000 - $100,000 per single parking spot.[^2]

# Policy
## By-Law 89-2022

[By-Law 89-2022](https://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/bylaws/2022/law0089.pdf) was introduced to amend By-Law 569-2013, updating regulations around parking minimums, after the municipality requested a review of the policy, suggesting a radical shift in the cities stance on parking. 

>"Review is guided by the principle that parking standards should allow only the maximum amount of automobile parking reasonably required for a given use and minimums should be avoided except where necessary to ensure equitable access, such as for accessible parking or in areas which would be difficult to serve with transit."[^1]
