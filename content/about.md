# The Problem
Traditional planning processes are disorganized and often leave everyone involved frustrated and confused. The lack of a central knowledge hub means that stakeholders are left in the dark, struggling to find the latest information on planning policies and projects. 
# Our Solution
Urban Wiki aims to address these challenges by creating a one-stop solution for planning information. We believe that a well-organized and easily navigable platform can empower residents, city councillors, and planners alike.
# Roadmap
Work in progress at the moment, but really our main focuses right now are:
- Creating more content
- Working on a suitable replacement for the software. We like how Quartz tries to organize digital gardens, but we want something more geared towards a wiki.
- User submissions through a website. Will make contributing easier.
