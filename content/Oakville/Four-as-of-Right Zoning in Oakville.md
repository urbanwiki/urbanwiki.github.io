_Four-units-as-of-right_ is a type of zoning by-law which permits by default small scale residential uses of up to four units per lot. This by-law is enabled by changes to the planning act by [[More Homes Built Faster Act|Bill 23]], which created expanded “as of right” development rights for small scale residential development.

# Policy Goals
- To get Oakville's [[Fund Housing Accelerator Fund]] application approved
- To increase the supply of residential units in Oakville
- To enable a "gentle density" intensification strategy
- To meet Oakville's [municipal housing target goals](https://www.ontario.ca/page/tracking-housing-supply-progress)

# What Is The Current By-Law?

[[More Homes Built Faster Act|Bill 23]], also contains a province-wide _three-units-as-of-right_ by-law which permits by default small scale residential uses of up to three units per lot. The difference between _three-units-as-of-right_ and _four-units-as-of-right_ is a single unit, so its a marginal difference per lot, but a larger difference province-wide.

# The Proposed By-Law
The effect of the proposed amendments to the [[Livable Oakville Plan]] and [[North Oakville East Secondary Plan]] will: 

- permit additional dwelling units subject to regulations of the Zoning By-law;
- ensure additional dwelling units do not count toward the calculation of density. 

The effect of the proposed amendments to Zoning By-law 2014-014 to Zoning By-law 2009-189 will: 
- redefine `accessory dwelling units` -> `additional dwelling units` throughout the by-laws, including for greater clarity definitions for `detached` and `attached` additional dwelling units;
- in addition to the primary dwelling unit, permit a maximum of three attached additional dwelling units within a detached dwelling on a lot; or permit a maximum of two attached additional dwelling units within a detached dwelling and one detached additional dwelling unit within an accessory building on a lot;
- regulate access requirements to additional dwelling units with a minimum of 1.0 metre exterior path of travel to the entrance;
- require a minimum of four parking spaces for detached dwellings that accommodate four dwelling units (primary dwelling unit plus three additional dwelling units).[^1]
## Key Points
- These zoning by-laws don't override existing municipal lot requirements like set-backs, parking, stormwater infrastructure, etc...

# Pros and Cons
| Pros                        | Details                                                                                                                    | 
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Removes red-tape            | No approval required by Town Council or public consultation to build four units on a lot                                   |
| Enables more housing supply | By allowing four units on a lot, residents can self-direct the growth of the housing supply                                |
| Gentle density              | The by-laws don't violate existing municipal by-laws, it preserves the character of neighbourhoods while achieving density |
| Community driven            | Community driven opportunity, where residents can decide what density they want                                            |

| Cons                                            | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Low usage                                       | So far in Oakville, only 0.003% of eligible units for _three-units-as-of-right_ have filed for new development. Its unlikely that without proper outreach and awareness that this number will increase |
| Doesn't guarantee new housing                   | By allowing four units on a lot, residents can self-direct the growth of the housing supply                                                                                                            |
| Doesn't include affordable housing requirements | The by-law doesn't make a requirement for any affordable units to be built on it's own. That would have to be done in another bill or amended to this one                                              |
