> Oakville Town Council will hear public feedback on [[Four-as-of-right|four-as-of-right]] zoning in Oakville on March 4 at the [Planning and Development Meeting](https://pub-oakville.escribemeetings.com/Meeting.aspx?Id=d1136dc5-4b20-4348-a39f-106acf75459e)
> You can view the proposed amendments [[Four-as-of-Right Zoning in Oakville#The Proposed By-Law|here]]

_Four-units-as-of-right_ is a type of zoning by-law which permits by default small scale residential uses of up to four units per lot. This by-law is enabled by changes to the planning act by [[More Homes Built Faster Act|Bill 23]], which created expanded “as of right” development rights for small scale residential development.

# What Would The Change Be?
[[More Homes Built Faster Act|Bill 23]], also contains a province-wide _three-units-as-of-right_ by-law which permits by default small scale residential uses of up to three units per lot. The difference between _three-units-as-of-right_ and _four-units-as-of-right_ is a single unit, so its a marginal difference per lot, but a larger difference province-wide.

# Policy Goals
- To get Oakville's [[Housing Accelerator Fund]] application approved
- To enable the creation of new supply of residential units in Oakville
- To enable a [gentle density](https://urbanlogiq.com/ask-the-experts-how-gentle-density-adds-housing-solutions/) intensification strategy
- To meet Oakville's [municipal housing target goals](https://www.ontario.ca/page/tracking-housing-supply-progress)

# The Proposed By-Law
The effect of the proposed amendments to the Livable Oakville Plan and North Oakville East Secondary Plan will: 

- permit additional dwelling units subject to regulations of the Zoning By-law;
- ensure additional dwelling units do not count toward the calculation of density. [^1]

## Key Points
- These zoning by-laws don't override existing municipal lot requirements like set-backs, parking, stormwater infrastructure, look-and-feel, etc...

# Pros and Cons
| Pros                        | Details                                                                                                                    | 
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Removes red-tape            | No approval required by Town Council or public consultation to build four units on a lot                                   |
| Enables more housing supply | By allowing four units on a lot, residents can self-direct the growth of the housing supply                                |
| Gentle density              | The by-laws don't violate existing municipal by-laws, it preserves the character of neighbourhoods while achieving density |
| Community driven            | Community driven opportunity, where residents can decide what density they want                                            |

| Cons                               | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Low usage                          | So far in Oakville, only 0.003% of eligible units for _three-units-as-of-right_ have filed for new development. Its unlikely that without proper outreach and awareness that this number will increase |
| Doesn't build new housing          | The by-law just says what is allowed to be built. It doesn't make any requirements to actually build something.                                                                                        |
