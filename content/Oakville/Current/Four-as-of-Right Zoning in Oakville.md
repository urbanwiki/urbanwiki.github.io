> Oakville Town Council will hear public feedback on [[Four-as-of-right|four-as-of-right]] zoning in Oakville on March 4 at the [Planning and Development Meeting](https://pub-oakville.escribemeetings.com/Meeting.aspx?Id=d1136dc5-4b20-4348-a39f-106acf75459e)
> You can view the proposed amendments [[Four-as-of-Right Zoning in Oakville#The Proposed By-Law|here]]

_Four-units-as-of-right_ is a type of zoning by-law which permits by default small scale residential uses of up to four units per lot. This by-law is enabled by changes to the planning act by [[More Homes Built Faster Act|Bill 23]], which created expanded “as of right” development rights for small scale residential development.

# What Would The Change Be?
Currently through [[More Homes Built Faster Act|Bill 23]], there is a province-wide by-law which permits by default small scale residential uses of up to three units per lot. This new by-law would give land-owners a right to build one extra unit on a lot with some restrictions (see: [[Four-as-of-Right Zoning in Oakville#Key Points]]).

# Policy Goals
- To enable the creation of new housing supply in Oakville.
- To enable a [gentle density](https://urbanlogiq.com/ask-the-experts-how-gentle-density-adds-housing-solutions/) intensification strategy.
- To meet Oakville's [municipal housing target goals](https://www.ontario.ca/page/tracking-housing-supply-progress).

# The Proposed By-Law
This is the proposed by-law from the Oakville website[^1]
> The effect of the proposed amendments to the [Livable Oakville Plan](https://www.oakville.ca/business-development/planning-development/official-plan/livable-oakville-plan/) and [North Oakville East Secondary Plan](https://www.oakville.ca/business-development/planning-development/official-plan/north-oakville-secondary-plans/Ï) will: 
> 
> - permit additional dwelling units subject to regulations of the Zoning By-law;
> - ensure additional dwelling units do not count toward the calculation of density.
> 
> The effect of the proposed amendments to Zoning By-law 2014-014 to Zoning By-law 2009-189 will: 
> - redefine “accessory dwelling units” to “additional dwelling units” throughout the by-laws, including for greater clarity definitions for “detached” and “attached” additional dwelling units;
> - in addition to the primary dwelling unit, permit a maximum of three attached additional dwelling units within a detached dwelling on a lot; or permit a maximum of two attached additional dwelling units within a detached dwelling and one detached additional dwelling unit within an accessory building on a lot;
> - regulate access requirements to additional dwelling units with a minimum of 1.0 metre exterior path of travel to the entrance;
> - require a minimum of four parking spaces for detached dwellings that accommodate four dwelling units (primary dwelling unit plus three additional dwelling units).

## Key Takeaways
- These amendments focus on expanding housing options by allowing additional dwelling units while addressing parking and access concerns. It's designed to provide clarity in terminology, define unit types, and establish regulations for their construction and use.
- Any extra units must be compliant with the building code and municipal by-laws.[^2] This means they ***cannot*** violate:
	- Building height restrictions
	- Setbacks
	- Aesthetic "look-and-feel" of the building
	- Parking requirements
# Pros and Cons
| Pros                           | Details                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Removes red-tape               | No approval required by Town Council or public consultation to build four units on a lot            |
| Enables more housing supply    | By allowing four units on a lot, residents can self-direct the growth of the housing supply         |
| Gentle density                 | It doesn't change the character of neighbourhoods while achieving density                           |
| Grants from Federal Government | This will likely end up with Oakville's housing a [[Housing Accelerator Fund]] application approved | 

| Cons                      | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Parking Minimums          | Parking minimums [lead to more expensive units](https://vtpi.org/park-hou.pdf), [more car usage in residential neighbourhoods](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0042098021995139), and are explicitly incongruent with the [guiding principles](https://www.oakville.ca/getmedia/79a4c2f3-905e-468a-be40-ace9bb79d97f/planning-livable-oakville-part-b-mission-statement.pdf) of the livable Oakville plan. |
| Low usage                 | So far in Oakville, only 0.003% of eligible units for _three-units-as-of-right_ have applied for a permit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Doesn't build new housing | The by-law just says what is allowed to be built. It doesn't make any requirements to actually build something.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
